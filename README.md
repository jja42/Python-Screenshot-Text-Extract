# Python Screenshot & Text Extractor

Two simple Python scripts that allow you to capture screenshots and extract text.

## Overview

### **Screenshot Tool** (`screenshot.py`)
Captures a **Customizable Region** of your screen instantly with a single key press.  
Unlike most screenshot tools, you only need to set the capture region **once**. Then you can take as many screenshots as you want without reselecting.

### **Text Extraction Tool** (`extract_text.py`)
Extracts text from your screenshots using **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** via [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).  
This is best suited for screenshots that are all or mostly text. It handles **batch processing**, meaning that you don't need to extract one by one.

### Why?
If you want to take multiple images of a set region without having to click and drag the screenshot area over and over again, this is for you.

If you want to get text from a screenshot of a video or a game, or text from a site that won't let you Ctrl +C, this is for you.
